# Demo-Code

Feb 11, 2018:
Contains demonstration code, sourced elsewhere &amp; slightly modified. 
Not much here right now, but I will be posting NN bits and Multi-Media bits.
Mostly working toward a baseline from existing code and data. 

Sep 1, 2020:
The demonstration code is still being baked, but it is almost done. 
It turns out that the research problem I am working on requires multiple components.
I'll start with a diagram and spin it from there. I have been very fortunate
to work with some great people who have helped out with my work.  Details to follow. 
Please stay safe !
